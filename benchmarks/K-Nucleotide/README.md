# K-Nucleotide
The **K-Nucleotide** problem, as presented in the **Computer Language Benchmarks Game (CLBG)**, involves analyzing the frequency of k-length nucleotide sequences (**k-mers**) within a given DNA sequence. This task is commonly used to compare the performance of different programming languages and algorithms in terms of execution speed and memory usage.

## Algorithm
To tackle the **K-Nucleotide** problem, the following steps are typically performed:

1. **Data Reading**: Load the DNA sequence from the input data.
2. **Sequence Filtering**: Remove any non-nucleotide characters to ensure that only valid nucleotides (A, C, G, T) are processed.
3. **K-mer Generation**: For a specified `k`, generate all possible k-mers by sliding a window of length `k` across the DNA sequence.
4. **Frequency Counting**: Use a dictionary or hash map to count the occurrences of each k-mer.
5. **Sorting and Output**: Sort the k-mers by frequency and lexicographical order to produce the final output.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n * k)**, where:
- `n` is the length of the DNA sequence.
- `k` is the length of the k-mer.

This complexity arises because the algorithm processes each nucleotide in the sequence and generates a k-mer for each position, performing constant-time operations for counting and storing frequencies.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(n) + O(m)** where:
- `O(n)` is for storing the DNA sequence.
- `O(m)` is for the frequency dictionary, where `m` is the number of unique k-mers.

In the worst-case scenario, `m` can be up to **4^k**, considering all possible combinations of `k` nucleotides. However, for larger `k` values, the actual number of unique k-mers is often much less due to biological sequence constraints.

## Implementation Approach
An efficient implementation of the **K-Nucleotide** algorithm involves:
- **Optimized I/O Operations**: Reading and writing data efficiently to handle large DNA sequences.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Using hash maps or dictionaries for rapid k-mer frequency counting.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizing multi-threading or parallel computing techniques to distribute the workload, especially beneficial for large datasets.
- **Memory Management**: Implementing strategies to manage memory usage effectively, such as processing the DNA sequence in chunks to avoid excessive memory consumption.

## Sample Input/Output
### **Input:**
```txt
>SEQ1

```

### **Output:** (For k=2)
```txt
AG: 3
CT: 3

```

## Pseudocode
```
BEGIN
    FUNCTION read_sequence(file_path)
        sequence = ""
        FOR each line in file:
            IF line does not start with '>' THEN
                Append line (stripped) to sequence
        RETURN sequence
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION count_kmers(sequence, k)
        kmers = empty dictionary
        FOR i from 0 to length(sequence) - k + 1 DO
            kmer = substring of sequence from i to i+k
            IF kmer exists in kmers THEN
                Increment count of kmer
            ELSE
                Add kmer to kmers with count 1
        RETURN kmers
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION print_kmer_frequencies(kmers)
        SORT kmers by frequency in descending order
        FOR each kmer in sorted list DO
            PRINT kmer and its frequency
    END FUNCTION

    MAIN
        sequence = read_sequence("input.txt")
        k = 2  // Example k-mer length
        kmer_frequencies = count_kmers(sequence, k)
        print_kmer_frequencies(kmer_frequencies)
    END MAIN
