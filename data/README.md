# Dataset: Python Energy Microscope

This directory contains **benchmark data** collected during the experiments of the paper:
**"Python Under the Microscope: A Comparative Energy Analysis of Execution Methods"**.

It includes **raw measurement logs**, **aggregated performance metrics**, and **normalized values** across five Python execution methods, covering **15 benchmark algorithms**.


## Dataset Access

The complete dataset is also publicly available on Kaggle:

ðŸ‘‰ **[Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatinshadab/python-energy-microscope-dataset)**

> The Kaggle version is ideal for data analysis, reproducibility testing, and direct import into notebooks or visual tools.

## Description of Contents

* **Raw CSVs**: Contain timestamped logs of 50 repeated runs per algorithmâ€“method pair.
* **Metrics**: Energy (Î¼J), Execution Time (s), and Estimated Carbon Emissions (gCOâ‚‚eq).
* **Normalized Data**: Used to calculate GreenScore via minâ€“max normalization per algorithm.
* **Analysis Folder**: Final processed results, including method-wise averages and rankings.

## Usage Notes

* All files are formatted for **pandas**-friendly import.
* Folder names match execution method names (`cpython`, `cython`, etc.).
* Reproducibility ensured with fixed inputs, consistent machine, and versioned code.
