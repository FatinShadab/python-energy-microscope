**Welcome to Python Energy Microscope.** This repository contains research code, benchmarks, and energy measurement scripts for the study **"Python Under the Microscope: A Comparative Energy Analysis of Execution Methods."**  

## **Overview**  
With growing concerns about **sustainable computing**, this study examines the **energy efficiency of different Python execution methods** to determine the most **energy-efficient (greenest) approach**.  

- **CPython** (Standard Interpreter)

    - Measure CPU and memory usage to understand their impact on power consumption.

2. **Practicality & Real-World Application**
    - Evaluate the scalability and practicality of each execution method for real-world applications.

    - Assess the ease of implementation of different execution methods.

3. **Sustainability & Green Computing**
    - Contribute to sustainable computing by identifying the most eco-friendly and efficient Python execution models.

## **Research Questions**  
- **Which Python execution method demonstrates the highest energy efficiency when executing pure Python code with minimal third-party libraries?**
- **What is the relationship between execution speed and energy consumption across different Python execution methods?**
- **Which Python execution method has the lowest carbon footprint according to software energy profiling?**

## **Benchmarking & Methodology**  
This study employs **a modified set of Computer Language Benchmarks Game (CLBG) algorithms**, blending standard performance benchmarks with **additional real-world computational tasks**. The benchmarking ensures **fair and consistent execution across all runtime environments** while maintaining **minimal dependencies** for pure execution measurement.
